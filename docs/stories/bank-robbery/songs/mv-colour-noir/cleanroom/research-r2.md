# Research round 2 (web only, 2026-10-30)

[vendor] Google says so. [tested] a reported run, or a museum object or period text. [reported] claimed, no test shown. [inference] my reasoning. No Omni car test exists that I could find.

## A. Stills (Nano Banana 2.1)

**1. Period masks**
- Wool; ribbed neck and face band, garter crown; khaki, c.1915. [tested] https://www.awm.gov.au/collection/C972117
- All-rib, long neck, grey Jaeger wool, 1911. [tested] https://www.rmg.co.uk/collections/objects/rmgc-object-4007
- 1917 patterns: 3-ply, four No. 8 needles, knit 2 purl 2, about 12in of rib; optional cape pieces. [tested] https://gutenberg.org/cache/epub/76611/pg76611-images.html
- Some sat loose round the face; some had ear holes. [reported] https://pieceworkmagazine.com/knitting-comforts-for-the-troops/
- 1930s colour names (tapestry wool, not knitting yarn): silver grey, Windsor green, marine, china blue, dull mauve, crimson, flame, Indian red, rust gold. [tested] https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O316532/
- 1927 felt: colours appliquéd in layers, stitched in black thread or matching silk. Search excerpt only; page wouldn't open. [reported] https://search.library.wisc.edu/digital/A4GPTMPITY7KSK8V/text/A33BK3MAGYIPJZ8P
- 1920s appliqué stitches, on a quilt: buttonhole, chain, running, stem. [tested] https://www.artic.edu/artworks/60737/sunbonnet-sue-quilt
- Not found: a 1920s motoring helmet, or photos with suit and hat. Those pairings, uneven hand-knitting and cut felt edges are [inference].

**2. Ring and triangle**
- Name exact materials; describe what you want, not what you don't. Reference image plus stated relationship is the logo route. [vendor] https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/ultimate-prompting-guide-for-nano-banana
- Left and right can swap in 2.1; anchor to objects, here a named eye or ear. [reported] https://picsart.com/blog/nano-banana-2-1-prompts/
- Centre drift and outline-versus-solid: no direct source. Try a filled patch of named cloth with a stitched edge, bare knit at the centre, a reference image, and several takes. [inference]
- Hidden faces: describe continuous knit where features would be, not "no eye holes". [inference]

**3. Several people**
- Multiple references (up to 14) are Google's consistency route; no multi-person method given. [vendor, Google link]
- 2.1 reportedly holds several characters better than 2, no figures; list what must not change. [reported, Picsart]
- Keep construction wording identical, change only colour, tie each colour to a position. [inference]

## B. Video (Omni Flash)

**4. Motion from a start frame**
- Mix framing and motion, style, light, location, action; no need to describe every frame. [vendor] https://deepmind.google/models/gemini-omni/prompt-guide/
- Be specific about camera, subject, environment. It may cut by default: ask for one continuous shot. Time beats in words or `[0-3s]`. Negatives go inline. [vendor] https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/omni
- "No human hands" still produced a hand. [tested, three prompts] https://pixverse.ai/en/blog/gemini-omni-video-model-review
- Quality reportedly falls past about 50 words; use motion verbs, not camera brands. [reported] https://geminiomniprompts.org/guide/
- Exact 8s timing is unverified; one API accepts only 3, 5 or 10s. [tested, Segmind link in 8]

**5. Cars** (none Omni-specific)
- Veo 3: artefacts in fast or close wheel shots; paint and glass reflections are tells. [reported] https://whichoneisreal.com/mode/videos/vehicles/
- Spell out physical behaviour and ground contact; state that objects persist; slower hides floatiness. [reported] https://genra.ai/blog/why-ai-videos-look-fake-how-to-fix
- Driver's eye: say whose eyes and which body parts show. [reported] https://invideo.io/faq/how-do-you-generate-a-first-person-pov-shot-with-ai/
- Hands: one clear action beats controlling everything. [reported] https://hackernoon.com/how-to-fix-warped-hands-and-faces-in-ai-generated-video
- Omni environments held; articulated motion broke. [tested, one prompt] https://www.mindstudio.ai/blog/gemini-omni-1-1-flash-video-model
- Keep tyres mid-distance, one event per clip, sparks from a stated contact point. [inference]

**6. City vistas**
- Landscapes were Omni's weak category, looking "animated". [tested, text-to-video votes] https://notes.designarena.ai/gemini-omni-flash-a-video-model-for-directors/
- Nothing on skyline flicker. State unchanging light; avoid mixed sources. [reported, Genra]
- Background morphs under camera moves: simplify, ask for consistency. [reported, Veo] https://www.veo3ai.io/blog/veo3-scene-transition-guide
- Reflections called a hard limit. [reported] https://www.opus.pro/blog/ai-slop-aesthetic-12-tells

**7. Ending on a transition**
- No Google guidance for one-frame endings. Google's tool is first and last frames: state each, the exact move, no jump cuts. [vendor, DeepMind]
- Whip pan: name the direction, blur at the peak, cut there. Foreground wipe: object fills the frame briefly, cut at full coverage. Allow 2–3 tries. [reported, Veo, seller's site, link in 6]
- Blur is the glue, not a tour. [reported] https://www.media.io/ai-prompts/ai-video-transition-prompts.html
- Give it a physical motivation. [reported] https://www.veo3ai.io/blog/veo3-scene-transition-guide
- Push into dark, match on shape or light: no source. Use a dark object already in the frame, arrive late, keep "one continuous shot", and don't describe the next scene. [inference]

**8. Refusals and tells**
- Filters cover prompts and outputs and vary by region; recognisable people blocked. [vendor, API link]
- False refusals of harmless prompts, unresolved in May; current state unknown. [reported] https://piunikaweb.com/2026/05/20/google-investigating-issue-gemini-omni-flash/
- Twelve prompts: masks, swords, period rifle passed; real politician and gore blocked; crime untested. Retrying a refused input fails; rewrite. [tested] https://blog.segmind.com/gemini-omni-flash-keeps-rejecting-your-prompts-9-fixes-that-actually-work/
- Policy names dangerous or illegal activity. [reported] https://geminiomniprompts.org/blog/why-gemini-omni-blocks-your-prompts/ Robbery wording may matter. [inference]
- Tells: floaty weight, drifting objects, lighting flicker [reported, Genra]; hand morphs, too-smooth motion, gibberish text, broken background extras [reported, Opus].
