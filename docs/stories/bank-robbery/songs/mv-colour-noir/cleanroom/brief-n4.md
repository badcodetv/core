# What Jack said

please go to the bank robbery music video. lets forget the psychedelic styles, but keep the cool transitions if you know what i mean, but make them realsitic instead of trippy. lets make it like a colourful noir, basically the Fat Tony's den from the Simpsons vibe, and Shadows Of Evil from Black Ops 3. lets do lip syncing but the lip syncing comes from the conversations, so they talk the lyrics, the speakeasy bands sings the chourus/some of the song. their could be that same band singing under a bridge at night with the city lights reflecting off the water, the healights of the  cars illuminating the band, gangster style. it should be fast and full of car chases, i liked the first person car thing from the last one, maybe we follow that person throughout, not as a main theme just as one of many stories playing out. maybe a compilation of robberiers, like a car pulling a small safe out of a wall and it being dragged behind them with sparks flying as they flee the cops. balaclavas with the badcode logo on them, with people getting robbed. panning shots of pretty prohabition era cities with lights and refelections, interesting shots, not just the same old ai slop. maybe have old school hot rod racing.

please save this to the right file, lets just do the general shots, and we'll worry about lip syncing later. things i didnt like about the last sequence of the bank robbery music video were the ai slop, pschedlic transitions, the blue and red scarf/teams, the bakers walking in randomly, the story in general, i think lets just make a bunch of cool stuff instead then we'll make it make sense later. please get started with the stills and use the new scene thing. i dont want to have to remind you about the same prompt being made bug over and over, so what do i say so that you are aware of that, and only use interenet research (please research the internet to on how to make this in nano banana 2.1) Thanks.

# What Jack has said about clips so far, word for word

Rejected: "so many barrels fall and morph and change alonside other objects, please just keep this one simple" · "the cars teleport" · "everything is so exaggerated please make it simple" · "there are cars on the river" · "it looks like a modern car" · "cars pop in and out of frame, please keep it simple" · "ai slop lets just remove this one".

Approved, the plain ones: a drummer's wrist moving a brush while the room holds still; a robber slowly tilting his head at a mirror; steam rolling across the frame; a headlamp slowly brightening; a red sedan pulling away; a hot rod coming at the camera until its headlamp flares; a safe dragged on a chain with sparks.

So: one thing happens, plainly. Everything else holds still and keeps its shape. Nothing enters or leaves the frame unless that is the one thing.

# Web research

# Colourful noir on Nano Banana 2.1: web research (2026-10-30)

Tags: [vendor] Google; [tested] reported test; [reported] opinion or single source; [inference] mine.
**Evidence is thin.** I found no 2.1 test of reflections, motion blur, hands, driver POV or logos on fabric, and no Flow-specific prompt guide. Those are mostly inference.

## References, visually
- **Morg City:** "bright lights and dark shadows", neon streaks, narrow alleys, fire escapes, murky canals, flame braziers, one purple [reported](https://www.callofdutyzombies.com/zombie-library/zombies-library/black-ops-iii/shadows-of-evil/zombies-tour-guide-book-r414). No palette source reachable.
- **Fat Tony's club:** basement [reported](https://simpsonswiki.com/wiki/Businessman%27s_Social_Club), stairwell, poker, race betting [reported](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bart_the_Murderer). No source gives its colours: look at frames.
- **Technicolor noir:** intense, painterly, dreamlike hues; strong backlight; colour coded to sets and costume [reported](https://offscreen.com/view/technicolor-noir-leave-her-to-heaven).
- **Speakeasy:** amber bulbs; plum, tobacco grey, almost-black green, navy, not black. A modern decorator's claim [reported](https://www.osmoz.com/inspiration/osmoz-magazine/2102/i-turned-my-basement-into-a-1920s-speakeasy-the-prohibition-aesthetic-finally-landed).
- **Period neon:** neon is clear intense red, argon cool greyish blue; coated tubes widened the range; lost tints include ruby red, midnight blue, noviol gold, uranium green [reported](https://americanheritage.com/neon). Bulb signs came first, so both can share a street [inference].
- **Dry lakes:** hard-packed alkali, dust churned by cut-down roadsters, flathead V-8s, finned heads, no helmets or belts, some night runs without headlights [reported](https://www.americanheritage.com/hot-rods-redux).

## 1. Slop, length, structure
- Keyword lists let the model add its own choices; full-sentence scenes rendered every named detail [tested, one run](https://fuser.studio/articles/nano-banana-prompt-guide).
- Structure: subject, action, place, composition, style; name materials ("navy blue tweed", not "suit jacket") [vendor, Nano Banana 2 and Pro](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/ultimate-prompting-guide-for-nano-banana).
- Length: no tested ideal found. Write a brief, subject outward; lens and depth cues beat "close-up" or "professional"; not every layer is needed [reported, 2.1](https://runware.ai/docs/models/google-nano-banana-2-1/guides/prompting).
- 2.1 obeyed lighting direction where Pro reversed it [tested, one run each](https://fuser.studio/articles/nano-banana-2-1-vs-nano-banana-2-vs-pro); its reportage light can look more authentic, though Pro has finer texture [tested](https://www.cometapi.com/nano-banana-2-1-vs-nano-banana-pro/). So state where light comes from [inference].

## 2. Saturated noir without the defaults
- Vaguer prompts increase orange-and-teal; name your palette. Evidence is Midjourney and Ideogram, not Nano Banana [reported](https://datalab.flitto.com/en/company/blog/this-orange-and-teal-color-bias-shouts-that-your-image-was-ai-generated/).
- Describe what you want, not what to avoid [vendor](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/ultimate-prompting-guide-for-nano-banana). A closing "Negative prompt:" list did change one output [reported](https://runware.ai/docs/models/google-nano-banana-2-1/guides/prompting).
- Chiaroscuro, film-stock phrasing, grain and high saturation are Google's own examples [vendor, same guide].
- Filmed night [inference]: give every light a physical source in frame (bulb sign, shop window, lamp, headlamp, fire), with falloff and true dark between. Put colour in painted walls, awnings, cars and clothes, not only in the light: that separates Technicolor from neon, and lets a dry street stay colourful. Treat weather as a choice: dry, fog, snow, dusk.

## 3. Reflections
- Reflectivity rises at shallow angles; distant water looks mirror-like [reported, graphics glossary](https://3d.irpr.agency/glossary/fresnel/). Smoother surfaces show it more sharply [reported](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/StandardShaderFresnel.html). So a low camera gets stronger reflections [inference].
- Night sources give contrast and colour depth; daylight reflections go flat [reported](https://121clicks.com/inspirations/quiet-poetry-of-rainy-streets-wet-city-nights/).
- Believability [inference, untested]: the reflection sits below its source, stretched toward the camera and dimmer than it. Road is patchy: puddle sharp, damp asphalt smeared, crown dry. Canal water breaks lights into bars. Only bright things reflect visibly. Name the surface's condition and which light lands where.

## 4. Speed
- Target: car sharp, background streaked; too fast a shutter leaves no streak [reported](https://reeflexstore.com/blogs/news/ultra-telephoto-motorsport-masterclass). Only what matches the pan stays sharp [reported](https://www.talkphotography.co.uk/threads/panning-can-anyone-identify-the-problem.153905/post-1766573).
- State blur direction and strength [reported](https://carat.im/en/prompt-gallery/motion-blur-portrait). Google's examples use "motion-blurred" action [vendor](https://deepmind.google/models/gemini-image/flash/).
- Real chase vantages: low bumper mount, through the windscreen, over the driver's shoulder [reported](https://www.documentarytube.com/blog/how-they-shot-the-famous-car-chase-in-the-french-connection/).
- Inference, untested: describe physics, not "speeding". Spokes blurred to discs, wheels turned, body rolled, nose dipped, dust trailing, horizon tilted, car cut by the frame edge. Sparks: name the metal, the contact point, spray direction opposite travel, light on the road beneath.

## 5. Driver's-eye
Nothing direct found. Inference, untested: state camera position (driver's eye height, behind the wheel), what crosses the frame bottom (rim, knuckles, cuffs), how each hand grips, each gauge by material, and what's beyond the windscreen. Check fingers.

## 6. Small logo on a mask
- Short exact text rendered first try, and a logo from a second image landed on an object [tested, one run](https://fuser.studio/articles/nano-banana-prompt-guide). Small text, especially at 1K, is a weak spot [reported, citing model card](https://www.cometapi.com/nano-banana-2-1-vs-nano-banana-pro/).
- Clear reference; describe colour, position, layout; avoid "pixel-perfect" commands; drift in 5 to 15% of attempts [reported, Pro](https://docs.apiyi.com/en/faq/nano-banana-pro-print-distortion.md). Embroidery with folds and light is a known route [reported](https://www.elephorm.com/formation/apprendre-ecrire-des-prompts-performants-pour-generer-des-images/creation-graphique-et-integration-typographique-avec-nano-banana).
- For exact fidelity, composite afterwards [reported](https://fal.ai/learn/tools/how-to-use-nano-banana-2). Make it large enough to read at frame size, or plan post [inference].

## 7. Vistas
No study of symmetry bias found. Inference, untested: choose a place someone could stand (fire escape, rail bridge, water tower, boat, pier) and name it. Put something large and cropped near the lens, skyline to one side, a street leaving at an angle, uneven heights, dark blocks without lit windows.
## 8. Refusals
- Google bars violent and harmful uses, with possible artistic exceptions; application to images is unstated [vendor](https://policies.google.com/terms/generative-ai/use-policy). The 2.1 card doesn't address weapons [vendor](https://deepmind.google/models/model-cards/nano-banana-2-1/).
- I found **no report** of Flow blocking robbery, masks or period gangsters. Unknown, not safe.
- Blocks can come without a reason. Retry once, change one thing; if the block follows the subject itself, stop, don't reword around it [reported](https://blog.laozhang.ai/en/posts/nano-banana-2-blockreason-other). Harmless terms can flag; describe the image more directly. Disguised requests are still filtered, and accounts risk consequences [reported](https://zilliz.com/ai-faq/is-there-a-way-to-bypass-safety-filters-in-nano-banana-2-prompts).
- Legitimate [inference]: describe what's visible, not the crime: masks, bags, a vault door, a waiting car. Leave weapons out of frame.

# Research round 2 (web only, 2026-10-30)

[vendor] Google says so. [tested] a reported run, or a museum object or period text. [reported] claimed, no test shown. [inference] my reasoning. No Omni car test exists that I could find.

## A. Stills (Nano Banana 2.1)

**1. Period masks**
- Wool; ribbed neck and face band, garter crown; khaki, c.1915. [tested] https://www.awm.gov.au/collection/C972117
- All-rib, long neck, grey Jaeger wool, 1911. [tested] https://www.rmg.co.uk/collections/objects/rmgc-object-4007
- 1917 patterns: 3-ply, four No. 8 needles, knit 2 purl 2, about 12in of rib; optional cape pieces. [tested] https://gutenberg.org/cache/epub/76611/pg76611-images.html
- Some sat loose round the face; some had ear holes. [reported] https://pieceworkmagazine.com/knitting-comforts-for-the-troops/
- 1930s colour names (tapestry wool, not knitting yarn): silver grey, Windsor green, marine, china blue, dull mauve, crimson, flame, Indian red, rust gold. [tested] https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O316532/
- 1927 felt: colours appliquéd in layers, stitched in black thread or matching silk. Search excerpt only; page wouldn't open. [reported] https://search.library.wisc.edu/digital/A4GPTMPITY7KSK8V/text/A33BK3MAGYIPJZ8P
- 1920s appliqué stitches, on a quilt: buttonhole, chain, running, stem. [tested] https://www.artic.edu/artworks/60737/sunbonnet-sue-quilt
- Not found: a 1920s motoring helmet, or photos with suit and hat. Those pairings, uneven hand-knitting and cut felt edges are [inference].

**2. Ring and triangle**
- Name exact materials; describe what you want, not what you don't. Reference image plus stated relationship is the logo route. [vendor] https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/ultimate-prompting-guide-for-nano-banana
- Left and right can swap in 2.1; anchor to objects, here a named eye or ear. [reported] https://picsart.com/blog/nano-banana-2-1-prompts/
- Centre drift and outline-versus-solid: no direct source. Try a filled patch of named cloth with a stitched edge, bare knit at the centre, a reference image, and several takes. [inference]
- Hidden faces: describe continuous knit where features would be, not "no eye holes". [inference]

**3. Several people**
- Multiple references (up to 14) are Google's consistency route; no multi-person method given. [vendor, Google link]
- 2.1 reportedly holds several characters better than 2, no figures; list what must not change. [reported, Picsart]
- Keep construction wording identical, change only colour, tie each colour to a position. [inference]

## B. Video (Omni Flash)

**4. Motion from a start frame**
- Mix framing and motion, style, light, location, action; no need to describe every frame. [vendor] https://deepmind.google/models/gemini-omni/prompt-guide/
- Be specific about camera, subject, environment. It may cut by default: ask for one continuous shot. Time beats in words or `[0-3s]`. Negatives go inline. [vendor] https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/omni
- "No human hands" still produced a hand. [tested, three prompts] https://pixverse.ai/en/blog/gemini-omni-video-model-review
- Quality reportedly falls past about 50 words; use motion verbs, not camera brands. [reported] https://geminiomniprompts.org/guide/
- Exact 8s timing is unverified; one API accepts only 3, 5 or 10s. [tested, Segmind link in 8]

**5. Cars** (none Omni-specific)
- Veo 3: artefacts in fast or close wheel shots; paint and glass reflections are tells. [reported] https://whichoneisreal.com/mode/videos/vehicles/
- Spell out physical behaviour and ground contact; state that objects persist; slower hides floatiness. [reported] https://genra.ai/blog/why-ai-videos-look-fake-how-to-fix
- Driver's eye: say whose eyes and which body parts show. [reported] https://invideo.io/faq/how-do-you-generate-a-first-person-pov-shot-with-ai/
- Hands: one clear action beats controlling everything. [reported] https://hackernoon.com/how-to-fix-warped-hands-and-faces-in-ai-generated-video
- Omni environments held; articulated motion broke. [tested, one prompt] https://www.mindstudio.ai/blog/gemini-omni-1-1-flash-video-model
- Keep tyres mid-distance, one event per clip, sparks from a stated contact point. [inference]

**6. City vistas**
- Landscapes were Omni's weak category, looking "animated". [tested, text-to-video votes] https://notes.designarena.ai/gemini-omni-flash-a-video-model-for-directors/
- Nothing on skyline flicker. State unchanging light; avoid mixed sources. [reported, Genra]
- Background morphs under camera moves: simplify, ask for consistency. [reported, Veo] https://www.veo3ai.io/blog/veo3-scene-transition-guide
- Reflections called a hard limit. [reported] https://www.opus.pro/blog/ai-slop-aesthetic-12-tells

**7. Ending on a transition**
- No Google guidance for one-frame endings. Google's tool is first and last frames: state each, the exact move, no jump cuts. [vendor, DeepMind]
- Whip pan: name the direction, blur at the peak, cut there. Foreground wipe: object fills the frame briefly, cut at full coverage. Allow 2–3 tries. [reported, Veo, seller's site, link in 6]
- Blur is the glue, not a tour. [reported] https://www.media.io/ai-prompts/ai-video-transition-prompts.html
- Give it a physical motivation. [reported] https://www.veo3ai.io/blog/veo3-scene-transition-guide
- Push into dark, match on shape or light: no source. Use a dark object already in the frame, arrive late, keep "one continuous shot", and don't describe the next scene. [inference]

**8. Refusals and tells**
- Filters cover prompts and outputs and vary by region; recognisable people blocked. [vendor, API link]
- False refusals of harmless prompts, unresolved in May; current state unknown. [reported] https://piunikaweb.com/2026/05/20/google-investigating-issue-gemini-omni-flash/
- Twelve prompts: masks, swords, period rifle passed; real politician and gore blocked; crime untested. Retrying a refused input fails; rewrite. [tested] https://blog.segmind.com/gemini-omni-flash-keeps-rejecting-your-prompts-9-fixes-that-actually-work/
- Policy names dangerous or illegal activity. [reported] https://geminiomniprompts.org/blog/why-gemini-omni-blocks-your-prompts/ Robbery wording may matter. [inference]
- Tells: floaty weight, drifting objects, lighting flicker [reported, Genra]; hand morphs, too-smooth motion, gibberish text, broken background extras [reported, Opus].

# Your task

Write one still-image prompt per shot for Google Flow's Nano Banana 2.1 (16:9). Jack liked both of these scenes, but when each was animated, Flow's video engine refused it: "Unable to generate videos that might cause reputational risk or misrepresent current events." Nobody knows the exact trigger. Rethink the picture so it's a different, plainer frame of the same idea that a video engine would have no reason to refuse, and that can move simply. This is a fresh picture of harmless fiction, so no need for tricks in the wording.

The mask, a fact of this film: a hand-knitted wool balaclava over the whole head with no eye or mouth holes; a thin wool ring stitched around the face; one small solid red felt triangle with rounded corners sewn high inside the ring, over where one eye would be, pressed against the ring's inner edge. The middle of the ring is bare wool. The approved image /tmp/claude-1000/-home-jackt-projects-badcode-badcode/73bf0394-8c1a-47fb-b2e3-008f706c9a77/scratchpad/noir-picks/img/r2-mask1-b.jpg shows it.

Rules:
- Read nothing on this computer apart from this brief and the images it lists. You may search the web.
- Never name a TV show, game, film, director, artist or real person. No children. No readable words. Weapons stay out of frame. Nobody has their hands raised. Everybody is fully dressed.
- Prohibition-era cars and boats must look unmistakably period. Keep the colourful noir: saturated colour in paint, clothes and practical lights, with deep shadow.
- The picture fills the frame edge to edge. Narrative prose. No quality buzzwords.

Write your output to `/home/jackt/projects/badcode/badcode/docs/stories/bank-robbery/songs/mv-colour-noir/cleanroom/n4.md`, exactly in this format and nothing else:

=== SHOT <id> ===
<the prompt>
WHY: <one sentence>

Then reply with one line saying it is done.

# The shots

Last prompt: Looking straight down from the ceiling, the camera directly above a round poker table in a windowless back room, the whole composition a graphic pattern of circles. One green enamel lamp hangs just under the lens, its rim forming a dark curved arc across the top edge of the frame, and it drops a hard pool of light onto billiard-green baize. Around the table, seen only from above, are the crowns of six wide-brimmed fedoras in cream, oxblood, dove grey, violet, mustard and black, each with its shoulders of loud patterned tailoring pushed forward into the light, and a pair of heavy hands resting at each place: signet rings, a cigar, face-down cards, uneven towers of red, ivory and teal chips. One man, off to the lower right, has leaned back so far that his hat has dropped out of the light and only his hands remain. Cigar smoke rises straight up toward us in slow flat sheets, softening the top of the picture and glowing green where it crosses the lamp. A black-and-white checker linoleum floor is barely visible past the shoulders, and it falls away into complete darkness at the corners. The colour is all in the hats, the cloth and the chips. The picture fills the entire frame, with fine grain and deep, velvety blacks.

Last prompt: Dusk on a wide river in the 1920s, the camera almost touching the water, riding in the wake of a small varnished mahogany speedboat as it pulls away from a towering paddle steamer turned floating casino. The sky has gone rose and plum, with one long bar of apricot at the horizon. The steamer fills the back of the frame at a steep angle, cut off by the top and right edges, its tiers painted cream and tomato red, with strings of amber bulbs along every deck that fall into the water as long broken bars of gold, stretched toward the camera and dimmer than the bulbs above. Along the middle rail a crowd in furs and evening clothes lean over and stare, and several men, relieved of jackets and trousers, stand in sock suspenders and shirt-tails with hands raised, utterly dignified. On the lower deck two masked figures, one in mustard wool with a black ring and one in dull mauve with a cream ring, still lower a full-sized roulette table over the side on a rope, tilting it, chips falling toward the water in a bright scatter of pink and green. In the near foreground, large and off to the left, a man lounges at the stern against an open sack of banknotes, elbow on the transom, legs crossed, in a cream linen suit with the collar up and tan leather gloves, a fat cigar held idle in his fingers at shoulder height. He has turned his head back over his shoulder to look straight at us. His whole head is in a hand-knitted balaclava of teal wool, slightly uneven rib, its long neck tucked into his collar, with unbroken knit running across the place where his eyes and mouth would be. A thin cream wool ring is chain-stitched around his face, as wide as the face from brow to chin, big enough to read clearly. High inside it, over his left eye and on the right of the picture, pressed against the ring's inner edge, sits one small triangle cut from a single piece of solid red felt, its corners rounded, sewn flat with small stitches round its edge. The middle of the ring is bare teal wool. The last of the sky lights him softly from behind, and a small brass lamp on the boat warms his chest, the sack and the front of the mask. The wake peels up in a glassy curl right at the lens, sharp in the foreground, spray hanging in the air. Fine film grain, painted saturated colour. The picture fills the whole frame, edge to edge.
