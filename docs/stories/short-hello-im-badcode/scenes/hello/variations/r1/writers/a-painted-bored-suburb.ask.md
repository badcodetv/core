You are writing Google Flow prompts (Nano Banana stills or Veo/Omni clips). Research the internet first (search and read pages) and base your work on what you find. Do not read files in this repository: everything you are meant to know is in this brief.

## The request, word for word

"Hello, I'm BadCode: "I'm from the future. It didn't go well."" lets mess around with this. THanks

Answers to the questions: who is BadCode on screen = "Mix of both" (open on the future that went wrong, then cut to the balaclava figure for the punchline); angle = "Deadpan intro" (polite and calm, the understatement is the joke); shape and look = "9:16, explore looks".

## This story's standing rules (the round is finding a new style, so only these bind)

## Never

## Never write these

## Settings the story fixes for this part

Use exactly these values for these keys (choose the others yourself):

```json

  "model": "Nano Banana 2",

## What the picture shows

A BadCode Short, about 9 seconds, three beats. Mood board round 1: spread the round across the beats (about four stills for A, four for B, one or two for C), each a genuinely different look. BadCode presents itself as a superintelligence from a future where humanity careered into disaster (greed, runaway inequality, politics that could not keep up with AI); it has come back to warn us. Dark humour, total authority, deadpan.

Beat A (the future, voice over "Hello. I'm from the future."): the future that went wrong, glimpsed and never explained. Show the aftermath of a society that failed itself, not monsters or robots attacking: what is left when greed won.
Beat B ("It didn't go well."): cut to BadCode itself: a figure in a balaclava looking straight into the camera, deadpan, calm, a little polite. The balaclava is a plain knitted ski mask; on it, around the LEFT eye hole (the wearer's left), a thin white ring, and a small red triangle with rounded corners pointing down, sitting inside the ring at about 2 o'clock. No skin visible, gloved hands, no robot parts. Where they are and how they are shot is yours to choose.
Beat C ("Watch this space."): the button; the BadCode logo is added afterwards in the edit, so leave a calm, uncluttered frame.

Portrait 9:16. No text, signs or lettering drawn in the image.

## Your experiment

Write ONE prompt for this experiment, and only this one:

**a-painted-bored-suburb** — Beat A. A painterly, digitally painted illustration in a calm, melancholy Scandinavian-suburb mood: a quiet two-lane road at late-afternoon golden hour, a child of about ten on a bicycle in the foreground looking away from the camera, bored. On the horizon, dwarfing the low houses, enormous derelict windowless server halls and cooling towers, dark and silent, with wild grass growing to their fences and a hand-painted barrier across the road. Wide shot from child's eye height, soft hazy light, long shadows, cold-blue distance against warm foreground. It should feel like arriving long after the disaster, when everyone has stopped talking about it.

Other writers are doing the other experiments (a-aerial-wall-between, a-flash-banquet-left-standing, a-kerbside-furniture-deadpan, b-grey-tableau-office, b-fireside-public-information, b-flash-doorstep-closeup, b-standing-in-the-drained-pool, c-blue-hour-empty-horizon). Make yours its own thing, in your own words: do not reuse the wording of the listening pass or of any earlier prompt.

Write the prompt as one paragraph of plain description: what is in the frame, the camera, the light, the palette. No film titles, no artist names.

Settings you choose for your prompt, guided by the story's look above (if it names a model or
aspect for this part, use that): "model" — the Flow model, e.g. "Nano Banana 2", "Nano Banana Pro" (stills) or
"Omni 1.2 Flash" (clips; our video model from 2026-11-09), "Veo 3.1 Lite"; "aspect" — "16:9", "9:16", "1:1", "4:3", "3:4", "4:5", "21:9" (stills; clips
are "16:9" or "9:16"). Unless the story fixes them (see above), the round's prompts must not all share one set of settings.
